# Exercise File Project.
Military exercise is a staged image of a situation or series of situations in an outline that simulates an existing or assumed military and operational reality.
The exercise is conducted to train and evaluate the functioning of military forces, commandership or troops and to learn lessons about planning, command and control, completion and execution of missions on time and at the required quality.
Prior to the exercise, an exercise file is conducted containing the necessary planning details and the required resource. At the end, an investigation in order to draw conclusions.
The expert system will transfer the exercise file process to the digital space, saving time and effort by auto completing from previous fields. The user will be able to open a new exercise file, manage current exercise files and review older ones. In addition, the system will provide the ability to add, edit or remove rules. The system will be structured in a client-server model.
